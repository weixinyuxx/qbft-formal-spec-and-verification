***: adversary should also be able to send other messages (unsigned or incorrectly signed)  --  if the implementation does not check signature, the proof will still pass

***: why the state of an adversary node cannot change

***: adversary: proposal can be signed by adversary, but other types of message cannot?







***: validDSState(s) in distributed system be a &&?



***: genesisBlock is not forced to be the first block in each blockchain
